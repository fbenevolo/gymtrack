# gymtrack

:muscle: Gymtrack is an application that I created to manage my progress at the exercising: gym, calisthenics and stretchings.

Through Gymtrack, I can:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  :computer: Register my routines

<hr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :chart_with_upwards_trend:Track my progress in all routines and exercises I do, be that in  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weight, repetition or time (in case of stretching and calisthenics)  

<hr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :watch: Motivate myself to continue working out by measuring my  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; progress over time  

<hr>

:iphone: I also have the plan to make a connect with my phone and register the progress while I'm in the gym through API calls. 
But that is more for the future!
